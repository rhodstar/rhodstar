# ModernFancyCV
a modern CV template for LaTeX to wow your next employer

![](/img/ModernFancyCV_2020.jpeg)

ModernFancyCV is a resume template for 2020 that aims to fulfill and surpass the expectations of any HR guy or gall. 
All important information fits on a single page while maintaining clarity.
It is aimed primarily at recent college grads, but everyone else can simply swap the "Education" and "Experience" sections and is ready to go.

Of course I suggest you swap out the "Sports Teams" in the Bubble-graphic for something more skills-oriented like "Programming Languages" or "Software". It´s totally up to you. Unfortunately, poor Doug can´t code...

NEEDED UPDATES:
1. I will try to layout a proper README.md in time.

2. Some time in the future I will try to fit all important options (mainly color choices) in the .tex file and pull them out of the .cls file.

Feel free to use and customize as you see fit.
